# Pose-Classifier
The aim of this project is to create a human pose classifier. Currently working on single person classification. Project workflow is as follows:

Use google colab GPU to create a pre-processing script to obtain stick figures (done). Note: Obtain trained weights for COCO model from this link: http://posefs1.perception.cs.cmu.edu/Users/ZheCao/pose_iter_440000.caffemodel

Use the pre processing script to create suitable training images (to do)

Build a classifier and train it on the images (to do)

Deploy the classifier on a web cam to get real time pose estimation. (to do)
